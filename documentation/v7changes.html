    </header>
    <h2 id="new-major-release">New major release</h2>
    <p>Gentium version 7 is a major release with many new additions,
    enhancements, and improvements. This is a summary of the most
    notable changes and what you need to know if you have been using
    earlier versions. <strong>Please read this carefully to understand
    the major changes.</strong> For further details on these changes,
    particularly regarding individual characters, see <a
    href="history.html">Version history</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="family-names-and-structure">Family names and structure</h2>
    <h3 id="font-family-names-have-changed">Font family names have
    changed</h3>
    <p>Since the changes to both line metrics and spacing are so
    extensive we have changed the names of the fonts for version 7.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><em>Gentium Plus</em> is now <em>Gentium</em></li>
    <li><em>Gentium Book Plus</em> is now <em>Gentium Book</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This enables you to keep the old v6.2 fonts installed when you
    install the new v7 ones. Projects and documents can then be
    gradually changed to use the new v7. <strong>We do recommend that
    you start using v7 right away and phase out your use of v6.2 as soon
    as possible.</strong></p>
    <h3 id="revised-family-groups-with-additional-weights">Revised
    family groups with additional weights</h3>
    <p>Both Gentium and Gentium Book families now have additional
    intermediate weights, with the previous Book family weights
    integrated into the main Gentium family. Previously existing weights
    in both families have not changed. The CSS values for the weights
    within each family are in parentheses. Italic faces follow a similar
    structure and correspondence.</p>
    <p><img src="assets/images/weights.png" class="fullsize"
    alt="New v7 weights" />
    <!-- PRODUCT SITE IMAGE SRC https://software.sil.org/gentium/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/05/weights.png --></p>
    <p>All the previous Book weights are present in the main Gentium
    family, so for many users the Book family is no longer needed. The
    main reason to use the Book family is if you prefer Gentium Book
    Regular as a primary text face and want to retain automatic style
    linking with Gentium Book Bold.</p>
    <p>The new intermediate weights in these extended, axis-based
    families can be confusing for applications that still assume
    families should have only four members (Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold
    Italic). This is the case for Microsoft Word and some older Windows
    applications. For details on how to use the intermediate weights in
    these applications, see <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/axis-based-fonts/">Using
    Axis-Based Font Families</a>.</p>
    <p>Gentium Book is now a separate download and is no longer included
    in the main Gentium package.</p>
    <h3
    id="decreased-default-line-spacing---and-no-compact-versions">Decreased
    default line spacing - and no Compact versions</h3>
    <p>The default line spacing of Gentium has been significantly
    decreased. In the past, line spacing had to be extreme to avoid
    clipping of tall letters and high diacritics on Windows. This is no
    longer a problem, so we’ve been able to reduce the default line
    spacing to be more similar to other common text fonts. <strong>We
    continue to recommend that you set line spacing explicitly in your
    document styles and preferences, and adjust it as needed for your
    particular situation.</strong></p>
    <p>The v7 fonts do not have <em>Compact</em> variants. The new
    default line spacing is closer to the previous version’s
    <em>Compact</em> line spacing. If you still need even closer line
    spacing, and your application does not allow explicit control over
    line spacing, you can continue to use the <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/download/">v6.2 Gentium Plus
    Compact fonts</a>, which remain available. <strong>If you need any
    of the new v7 features or characters, but also need them supported
    in a compact version please <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/gentium/about/contact/">contact
    us</a>.</strong></p>
    <p>TypeTuner Web no longer offers line spacing alternatives for the
    v7 fonts (Normal, Tight, Loose). If you need Tight or Loose variants
    the v6.2 fonts remain available and support line spacing
    alternatives.</p>
    <h3
    id="special-purpose-modified-variants-have-not-been-updated-to-v7">Special-purpose
    modified variants have not been updated to v7</h3>
    <p>In previous versions, special-purpose modified font variants were
    available that had been ‘pre-tuned’ to turn on certain features by
    default for some regional and <em>Literacy</em> uses. These are not
    available for the v7 fonts, however, the <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/download/">v6.2
    special-purpose fonts are still available</a>. <strong>If you need
    any of the new features or characters in this version, but also need
    them supported in the special-purpose modified fonts please <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/gentium/about/contact/">contact
    us</a>.</strong></p>
    <p>Note that even in version 7 the literacy forms and other features
    can be manually preset with TypeTuner Web. The only change to this
    is that the 'pre-tuned' versions (only) remain at version 6.2.</p>
    <h2 id="new-features-and-character-support">New features and
    character support</h2>
    <h3 id="greatly-enhanced-kerning">Greatly enhanced kerning</h3>
    <p>Kerning has now been expanded to cover the full range of
    alphabetic symbols except for small caps (which will be included in
    a future update). To make this practically useful for a wide range
    of languages the letters have been clustered into overly generalized
    groups. This enables the kerning to apply to more combinations, but
    does not allow for careful fine-tuning. The expanded kerning may not
    be ideal in all cases, and may still require manual adjustment, but
    it should provide improved spacing compared with previous versions.
    It is very possible that we have made some mistakes in this massive
    kerning effort, so please <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/gentium/about/contact/">contact
    us</a> if you encounter any combinations whose spacing has been made
    worse than in v6.2.</p>
    <p><strong>Warning: Because of the addition of extensive kerning,
    line, paragraph, and page lengths may be different from
    v6.2.</strong></p>

    alt="Expanded kerning" />
    <!-- PRODUCT SITE IMAGE SRC https://software.sil.org/gentium/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/05/kerning.png --></p>
    <h3 id="proportional-oldstyle-figures">Proportional Oldstyle
    figures</h3>
    <p>Gentium now includes support for standard OpenType proportional
    oldstyle figures (<code>onum</code>). These only apply to the main
    numerals, not fractions, superscripts, or numeral-based symbols.</p>
    <p><img src="assets/images/oldstylefigures.png" class="fullsize"
    alt="Oldstyle figures" />
    <!-- PRODUCT SITE IMAGE SRC https://software.sil.org/gentium/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/05/oldstylefigures.png --></p>
    <h3 id="greek-improvements">Greek improvements</h3>
    <p>Greek OpenType support is significantly more robust, with better
    handling of both combining and non-combining diacritics. Macron +
    diacritic combinations are now supported, as well as some rare
    epsilon and omicron diacritic combinations. Small caps (both
    <code>smcp</code> and <code>c2sc</code>) are supported, with
    diacritics bring removed.</p>

    alt="Greek improvements" />

    <h3
    id="capital-n-left-hook-default-changed-to-lowercase-style">Capital
    N Left Hook default changed to lowercase style</h3>
    <p>The default form for capital N with left hook has been changed to
    the lowercase style to match the capital Eng. The related feature
    (<code>cv44</code>) has been changed to substitute the uppercase
    style form. See the <a href="features.html">Feature list</a>.</p>
    <h3
    id="additional-character-support-including-unicode-16">Additional
    character support including Unicode 16</h3>
    <p>Support has been added for 29 additional characters, some of
    which were introduced in Unicode 16. For a full list see <a
    href="history.html">Version history</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="consistent-autohinting">Consistent autohinting</h2>
    <p>Autohinting has been improved to be more consistent across the
    whole family.</p>
    <p><img src="assets/images/v7autohinting.png" class="fullsize"
    alt="Gentium autohinting" />
    <!-- PRODUCT SITE IMAGE SRC https://software.sil.org/gentium/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/05/v7autohinting.png --></p>
    <p>Upright and italic faces appear more consistent in height in
    smaller sizes (Windows 11, Word, 9 pt, 150%, enlarged)</p>
    <h2 id="general-improvements">General improvements</h2>
    <p>Other improvements have been made to over 150 glyphs, OpenType
    code, and other font aspects, including:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Letters with upper-right hooks have been redesigned to improve
    spacing (including kerning) and reduce collisions. Some collisions
    have been retained to reduce unwanted whitespace within words (e.g.
    ƴk).</li>
    <li>Central European carons have improved designs and kerning.</li>
    <li>Bridging diacritics handle many more possible combinations. See
    <a href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/bridging-diacritics/">Using
    Bridging Diacritics</a> for details on how these need to be encoded
    and ordered.</li>
    <li>Low-profile diacritics are used for capitals for Cyrillic as
    well as Latin.</li>
    <li>Small caps apply to bracketing punctuation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more details see <a href="history.html">Version
    history</a>.</p>

    suggestions on how we can make the fonts better, please <a
