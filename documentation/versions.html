    <h2 id="announcement-list">Announcement list</h2>
    <p>If you would like stay informed of updates to Gentium and other
    SIL fonts, please subscribe to the <a
    href="https://groups.google.com/a/groups.sil.org/forum/#!forum/sil-font-news">SIL
    Font News Announcement List</a>. For more information see <a
    href="about.html">About</a>.</p>
    <p>Our font announcements are also available through X (formerly
    Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/silfonts">@silfonts</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="current-versions">Current versions</h2>
    <p>The latest version of the fonts is always available from the <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/gentium/download/">Gentium download
    page</a> as a .zip archive for all major platforms.</p>
    <p>This font package is also available in the <a
    href="https://packages.sil.org/">SIL software repository for
    Ubuntu</a>. Users can subscribe to this software repository and get
    current versions and updates automatically.</p>
    <p>Gentium is also available through the <a
    href="https://typetunerweb.languagetechnology.org/ttw/fonts2go.cgi">TypeTuner
    Web</a> service, which allows you to choose among the smart font
    features and download a font with those features preset. This
    enables them to work in many applications that do not fully support
    OpenType. <strong>Please note that the version 7 fonts available
    through TypeTuner Web no longer offer line spacing alternatives
    (Normal, Tight, Loose). If you need Tight or Loose variants the
    version 6.200 fonts remain available and support line spacing
    alternatives.</strong></p>
    <h2 id="compact-versions"><em>Compact</em> versions</h2>
    <p>The Gentium version 7 fonts do not have <em>Compact</em>
    variants. The default line spacing has been reduced to be closer,
    but not identical, to the previous version’s <em>Compact</em> line
    spacing. Most users should use the version 7 fonts and adjust line
    spacing explicitly within the application if necessary. If your
    application does not allow control over line spacing, you can use
    the <a href="https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/download/">version
    6.200 Gentium Plus Compact fonts</a>, which remain available.
    <strong>If you need any of the new version 7 features or characters,
    but also need them supported in a compact version please <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/gentium/about/contact/">contact
    us</a>.</strong></p>
    <h2 id="special-purpose-modified-variants">Special-purpose modified
    variants</h2>
    <p><a href="https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/download/">Modified
    versions of the Gentium Plus version 6.200 fonts</a> are available
    that have been ‘tuned’ to turn on certain features by default. These
    are available for some regions and include <em>Literacy</em>
    versions. <strong>These remain at version 6.200 and have not been
    updated to Gentium version 7. If you need any of the new features or
    characters in this version, but also need them supported in the
    special-purpose modified fonts please <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/gentium/about/contact/">contact
    us</a>.</strong></p>
    <h2 id="version-5-subsets">Version 5 subsets</h2>
    <p>In the past, special <em>subset</em> versions of Gentium Plus
    version 5 were created for specific uses. Those fonts still work and
    <a href="https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/font-subsets/">remain
    available</a>. These are limited versions of the fonts that support
    only the characters needed for a particular area or use. Subsets are
    available for Africa, Americas, Asia/Pacific, Europe/Eurasia,
    Vietnam, Phonetic, Cyrillic (Basic) and Cyrillic Extended. With the
    exception of the Phonetic font, the font subsets are intended for
    orthographic use only. We have not put anything in the other subsets
    for phonetic, transliteration, or transcription use. For those
    purposes, use the Phonetic subset. We do not intend to update these
    fonts, however they may still work. <strong>We do not, however,
    recommend their use. In almost all cases the standard font is a
    better choice. Font size is less of a concern than it was years ago,
    particularly with improved compression technologies such as
    woff2.</strong></p>
    <h2 id="gentium-basic">Gentium Basic</h2>
    <p><a href="https://software.sil.org/gentium/download/">Gentium
    Basic</a> was a limited-character-set version of Gentium, based on
    version 5. <strong>It remains available from the from our <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/gentium/download/previous-versions">Previous
    Versions archive</a> but is not recommended.</strong></p>
    <h2 id="previous-versions">Previous versions</h2>
    <p>Previous versions remain available from our <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/gentium/download/previous-versions">Previous
    Versions archive</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="change-history">Change history</h2>
    <p>A detailed list of changes for each version of the fonts is on
    the <a href="history.html">Version history page</a>.</p>
