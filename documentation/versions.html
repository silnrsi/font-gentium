    <h2 id="announcement-list">Announcement list</h2>
    <p>If you would like stay informed of updates to Gentium and other SIL fonts, please subscribe to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/groups.sil.org/forum/#!forum/sil-font-news">SIL Font News Announcement List</a>. For more information see <a href="about.html">About</a>.</p>
    <p>Our font announcements are also available through Twitter <span class="citation" data-cites="silfonts">[@silfonts]</span>(http://twitter.com/silfonts).</p>
    <h2 id="current-versions">Current versions</h2>
    <p>The latest version of the fonts is always available from the <a href="https://software.sil.org/gentium/download/">Gentium download page</a> as a .zip archive for all major platforms.</p>
    <p>This font package is also available in the <a href="https://packages.sil.org/">SIL software repository for Ubuntu</a>. Users can subscribe to this software repository and get current versions and updates automatically.</p>
    <p>Gentium Plus is also available through the <a href="https://scripts.sil.org/ttw/fonts2go.cgi">TypeTuner Web</a> service, which allows you to choose among the smart font features and download a font with those features preset. This enables them to work in many applications that do not make use of Graphite or OpenType Stylistic Sets. <em>TypeTuner Web currently uses version 5 fonts, however we will be working to update it to use the newest version 6 fonts soon.</em></p>
    <h2 id="version-5-subsets-and-modified-variants">Version 5 subsets and modified variants</h2>
    <p>Special versions of Gentium version 5 were created for specific uses. Those fonts still work and remain available:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p><a href="https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/font-subsets/">Font subsets</a> are limited versions of the fonts that support only the characters needed for a particular area or use. Subsets are available for Africa, Americas, Asia/Pacific, Europe/Eurasia, Vietnam, Phonetic, Cyrillic (Basic) and Cyrillic Extended. With the exception of the Phonetic font, the font subsets are intended for orthographic use only. We have not put anything in the other subsets for phonetic, transliteration, or transcription use. For those purposes, use the Phonetic subset.</p></li>
    <li><p><a href="https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/download/">Modified fonts</a> are fonts that have been ‘tuned’ to turn on certain features by default. These are available for some regions and for literacy uses.</p></li>
    <li><p><a href="https://software.sil.org/gentium/download/">Gentium Basic</a> are fonts that have been ‘tuned’ to turn on certain features by default. These are available for some regions and for literacy uses.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not intend to update these fonts to version 6, however they should continue to work. <strong>If you have a need for any of these fonts to be updated to version 6 please <a href="https://software.sil.org/gentium/about/contact/">contact us</a>.</strong></p>
    <h2 id="previous-versions">Previous versions</h2>
    <p>Previous versions remain available from our <a href="https://software.sil.org/gentium/download/previous-versions">Previous Versions archive</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="change-history">Change history</h2>
    <p>A detailed list of changes for each version of the fonts is on the <a href="history.html">Version history page</a>.</p>
