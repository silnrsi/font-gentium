    </header>
    <p>Gentium is a typeface family designed to enable the diverse
    ethnic groups around the world who use the Latin, Cyrillic, and
    Greek scripts to produce readable, high-quality publications. It
    supports a wide range of Latin- and Cyrillic-based alphabets.</p>
    <p>The design is intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact,
    and visually attractive. The additional ‘extended’ Latin letters are
    designed to naturally harmonize with the traditional 26 ones.
    Diacritics are treated with careful thought and attention to their
    use. Gentium also supports both polytonic and monotonic Greek.</p>

    <p>For a complete list of characters included in Gentium, see <a
    href="charset.html">Character Set Support</a>.</p>
    <p>Gentium has been designed to balance the need for a compact,
    legible typeface with the need for an attractive, friendly one. The
    overall tensions that influenced the design are summarized by the
    following table:</p>

    Type Specimen (A5 format)</a>. This publication was prepared for the
    University of Reading and was distributed to all attendees of the
    ATypI conference in Rome, September 2002. It also includes examples
    of the glyph set supported by Gentium and shows it in use for a
    variety of settings (Regular/Italic, Latin/Greek, Prose/Poetry,
    Display/Text).</p>
