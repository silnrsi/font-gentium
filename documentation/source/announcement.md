Release 7.000 - Major release with big changes

Gentium version 7 is a major release with many new additions, enhancements, and improvements. ***Note that this is a major upgrade with significant changes to family structure, line spacing, and glyph metrics. Please read the following carefully to understand how the changes may affect you.***

Both desktop and web fonts are provided in a single, all-platforms package on the [Download page](https://software.sil.org/gentium/download).

#### Font names, family structure, and line metrics

- Font family names have changed. It is possible to have both this release (v7) and the previous one (v6.2) installed at the same time. This is a permanent change intended to help with the transition from v6.2 to v7.
    - *Gentium Plus* is now *Gentium*
    - *Gentium Book Plus* is now *Gentium Book*

- Gentium and Gentium Book families now have additional intermediate weights, with the previous Book family weights integrated into the main Gentium family. Previously existing weights in both families have not changed. Here is a comparison, with retained weights in **bold** and new weights in *italic*. The CSS values for the weights within each family are in parentheses. Italic faces follow a similar structure and correspondence.

Gentium family            | Gentium Book family
------------------        | -----------------------
**Gentium Regular** (400) | 
*Gentium Medium* (500)    | **Gentium Book Regular** (400)
*Gentium SemiBold* (600)  | *Gentium Book Medium* (500)
**Gentium Bold** (700)    | *Gentium Book SemiBold* (600)
*Gentium ExtraBold* (800) | **Gentium Book Bold** (700)

- The Gentium Book family is now a separate download and is no longer included in the main Gentium package.

- The default line spacing has been significantly decreased to be more similar to other common text fonts.

- There are no *Compact* variants. These are less needed since the default line spacing has been decreased. *Compact* versions of the v6.2 fonts remain available from https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/download/

- TypeTuner Web no longer offers line spacing alternatives for the v7 fonts (Normal, Tight, Loose). If you need Tight or Loose variants the v6.2 fonts remain available and support line spacing alternatives.

- There are no ‘pre-tuned’ regional or *Literacy* special-purpose modified variants. The v6.2 variants, including *Literacy* versions, remain available from https://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/download/. You can still manually create v7 variants with TypeTuner Web that include literacy forms and other alternatives.

#### New features and enhancements

- Kerning has now been expanded to cover the full range of alphabetic symbols except for small caps (which will be included in a future update). **Warning: Because of the addition of extensive kerning, line, paragraph, and page lengths may be different from v6.2.**

- Greek OpenType support is significantly more robust, with better handling of both combining and non-combining diacritics. Macron + diacritic combinations are now supported, as well as some rare epsilon and omicron diacritic combinations. Small caps (both `smcp` and `c2sc`) are supported, with diacritics bring removed.

- Proportional Oldstyle figures are now supported through the standard OpenType feature (`onum`). These only apply to the main numerals, not fractions, superscripts, or numeral-based symbols.

- The default form for capital N with left hook has been changed to the lowercase style to match the capital Eng. The related feature (`cv44`) has been changed to substitute the uppercase style form.
