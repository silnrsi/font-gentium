    </header>
    <p>Common ancient Greek letter+diacritic combinations have been
    supported in Gentium since its first release. Version 7 extends this
    support to less common and even very rare combinations with much
    more robust OpenType handling.</p>
    <p>Most OS and application environments handle common combinations
    well, as the text often uses the large set of precomposed character
    clusters included in Unicode (e.g. ᾃ U+1F83 GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA
    WITH DASIA AND VARIA AND YPOGEGRAMMENI). Complex combinations that
    do not have corresponding precomposed characters (e.g. alpha +
    macron + dasia) can cause more difficulty. These require that the
    characters are in a precise order that follows Unicode ordering -
    see section 2.11 of <a
    href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/ch02.pdf">The
    Unicode Standard</a>.</p>
    <p>Each cluster consists of a base letter followed by one or more
    diacritics and an optional iota, and must be in the following order.
    Note that this is not necessarily the order in which they are
    commonly written from left to right, especially in the case of
    capitals.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>base + [length] + [breathing|diaeresis] + [accent] + [circ] +
    [iota]</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Groups:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>base: all alphabetic characters with no additional
    diacritics</li>
    <li>length: U+0304 macron; U+0306 vrachy (breve)</li>
    <li>breathing|diaeresis: U+0313 psili (smooth, comma above); U+0314
    dasia (rough, reversed comma above); U+0308 dialytika (diaeresis)
    <ul>
    <li>U+0343 koronis is also in this group but is not recommended</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>accent: U+0300 varia (grave); U+0301 oxia, tonos (acute)
    <ul>
    <li>U+0344 dial+tonos is also in this group but is not
    recommended</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>circumflex: U+0342 perispomeni</li>
    <li>iota: U+0345 ypogegrammeni</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This order also assumes that the clusters are fully decomposed
    (separated) into their individual characters. You cannot assume that
    you can add a diacritic to a precomposed cluster. For example, you
    cannot reliably construct U+1F04 GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI
    AND OXIA with the sequence U+1F00 GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH
    PSILI + U+0301 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT. This may work in some
    environments but not others.</p>
    <p>Gentium version 7 does, however, provide specific support to
    hybrid precomposed+diacritic combinations that include U+0304
    COMBINING MACRON. This increases the likelihood that these
    combinations will render properly:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>(precomposed base with length) + [breathing|diaeresis] +
    [accent]</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>U+1FD1 GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH MACRON + U+0314 COMBINING
    REVERSED COMMA ABOVE + U+0301 COMBINING ACUTE</p>
    <p>We still strongly recommend using the normal decomposed sequence
    for this cluster:</p>
    <p>U+13B9 GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA + U+0304 COMBINING MACRON + U+0314
    COMBINING REVERSED COMMA ABOVE + U+0301 COMBINING ACUTE</p>
    <p>Properly encoding and rendering complex sequences depends on many
    factors: the software keyboard that turns keystrokes into
    characters, internal operating systems routines that handle Unicode
    composition and decomposition, OpenType rules in the font, and the
    rendering engine used by the application. If a sequence is not
    rendering well the problem could be with any one or more of these
    factors. Contact us if you have problems, and tell us details of the
    operating system, application, keyboard, and font version. Please
    also include the exact character sequence you're using and a
    screenshot of the problem.</p>
