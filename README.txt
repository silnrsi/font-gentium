TIPS
====

As this font is distributed at no cost, we are unable to provide a 
commercial level of personal technical support. The font has, however, 
been through some testing on various platforms to be sure it works in most
situations.

If you do find a problem, please do report it to fonts@sil.org.
We can't guarantee any direct response, but will try to fix reported bugs in
future versions.

Many problems can be solved, or at least explained, through an understanding
of the encoding and use of the fonts. Here are some basic hints:

Encoding: 
The fonts are encoded according to Unicode, so your application must support
Unicode text in order to access letters other than the standard alphabet.
Most Windows applications provide basic Unicode support. You will, however,
need some way of entering Unicode text into your document.

Keyboarding:
This font does not include any keyboarding helps or utilities. It uses the
built-in keyboards of the operating system. You will need to install the
appropriate keyboard and input method for the characters of the language you
wish to use. If you want to enter characters that are not supported by any
system keyboard, the Keyman program (https://keyman.com/) can be helpful.

If you want to enter characters that are not supported by any system
keyboard, and to access the full Unicode range, we suggest you use
gucharmap, kcharselect on Ubuntu or similar software.

Another method of entering some symbols is provided by a few applications such
as Adobe InDesign or LibreOffice.org. They can display a glyph palette or input
dialog that shows all the glyphs (symbols) in a font and allow you to enter
them by clicking on the glyph you want.
